# RabbitKiller
Kill a virus known as a rabbit once it's started running on your PC! 

However, you need to have this programming running BEFORE it starts running.

Comments:  Currently is an extreme safemode program that will not allow any processes that aren't already running to open.
It does it's job, but it might do it too well for most people!

TODO: Add a way to whitelist processes permantely/on the fly.
